## 1. Frontend/Backend Alpha Handoff

### 1a. Store / payments / subscriptions COMPLETE
- Frontend wiring now covers backend catalog, purchase flows, inventory refresh, subscription
  refresh, `POST /store/iap/validate`, and in-app Stripe/PayPal return handling.
- Payment return routing and post-return reconciliation are in place.

### 1b. Users / profile / social COMPLETE
- Backend search-by-handle is wired for add-friend.
- Career-summary fetch is wired into the enhanced profile experience.
- Loadout `GET` / `PUT` wiring is implemented for hydration and save.
- `DELETE /friends` is wired for unfriend.

### 1c. Questions gameplay COMPLETE
- Question retrieval now prefers `GET /questions/set`.
- Per-question validation uses `POST /questions/check`.
- End-of-quiz authoritative reconciliation uses `POST /questions/check-batch`.
- Legacy/local fallback remains available where needed for resilience.

### 1d. Crypto economy player surfaces REMAINING
- Still needed:
- Player-facing wallet balance integration
- Transaction/history integration
- Wallet link / withdraw UX
- Staking and unstaking UI
- Feature-flag strategy for staged rollout
- Backend endpoints available for consumption:
- `POST /crypto/link-wallet`
- `GET /crypto/balance/{playerId}`
- `GET /crypto/history/{playerId}`
- `POST /crypto/withdraw`
- `POST /crypto/stake`
- `POST /crypto/unstake`
- `GET /crypto/staking/{playerId}`
- Recommended file targets:
- `lib/core/services/crypto/crypto_service.dart`
- `lib/core/models/crypto/`
- `lib/game/providers/crypto_providers.dart`
- `lib/screens/store/crypto_wallet_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/store/crypto_history_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/store/crypto_staking_screen.dart`
- `test/core/services/crypto/`
- `test/game/providers/crypto_providers_test.dart`

### 1e. ML enhancement signal consumption REMAINING
- Still needed:
- Frontend service/provider consumption for `POST /ml/churn-risk`
- Frontend service/provider consumption for `POST /ml/match-quality`
- Optional UX treatment and telemetry for `source` values (`deployed-model` vs `heuristic`)
- These should remain optional enhancement signals rather than hard dependencies for core UX.
- Recommended file targets:
- `lib/core/services/ml/ml_signal_service.dart`
- `lib/core/models/ml/`
- `lib/game/providers/ml_providers.dart`
- `lib/core/services/analytics/`
- `lib/screens/home/`
- `lib/screens/question/`
- `test/core/services/ml/`
- `test/game/providers/ml_providers_test.dart`

---

## 2. Phase 2 - Crash Recovery + Core Stubs

### 2a. Crash recovery state restoration COMPLETE
- **Files:** `lib/main.dart`, `lib/core/services/crash_recovery_service.dart`,
  `lib/core/services/state_persistence_service.dart`
- **Completed:** Crash/restart recovery now rehydrates saved quiz progress, player progress,
  and persisted profile/session metadata. Recovery acceptance also clears the crash flag so
  the restore prompt does not loop on the next clean launch.

### 2b. Notification persistence COMPLETE
- **Files:** `lib/core/bootstrap/app_init.dart`,
  `lib/game/providers/notification_history_store.dart`,
  `lib/game/providers/notification_template_store.dart`
- **Completed:** Notification templates and notification history are now restored from
  persistent storage during app bootstrap, so restart no longer drops the in-app notification
  context/history used by the admin and notification surfaces.

### 2c. Profile avatar cropping COMPLETE
- **Files:** `lib/game/controllers/profile_avatar_controller.dart`
- **Completed:** The active avatar picker flow already performs a centered square crop and
  JPEG re-encode before persisting the chosen avatar path. This backlog item was stale and has
  been reclassified as complete.

### 2d. Remaining `UnimplementedError` throws RESOLVED

| File | Line | Detail | Resolution |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| `lib/game/providers/core_providers.dart` | 41 | Provider stub | Intentional design-time guard; doc comment added clarifying it is overridden at startup |
| `lib/core/services/analytics/app_lifecycle.dart` | 18 | Lifecycle provider stub | Intentional design-time guard; doc comment added clarifying override via `AppLifecycleObserver` |
| `lib/screens/rewards/spin_earn_screen.dart` | n/a | Stale comment referencing a replaced `UnimplementedError` | Stale comment removed |

---

## 3. Phase 3 - Test Coverage Remaining Gaps

**Current:** 45 test files / 1,088 source files ~= **4.1%** (target: **40%** on `lib/game/` and `lib/core/`)

### 3a. Arcade game controllers COMPLETE

| File added | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `test/arcade/games/memory_flip_controller_test.dart` | `MemoryFlipController` - initial state, deck structure, `flip()` (first/match/miss/ignored), `allMatched -> isOver`, `toResult()`, `dispose()` |
| `test/arcade/games/pattern_sprint_controller_test.dart` | `PatternSprintController` - initial state, `answer()` (correct/wrong/lock), streak multiplier, question generation across all difficulties, `toResult()`, `dispose()` |

### 3b. Presence services (not yet tested)

#### `RichPresenceService` (`lib/core/services/presence/rich_presence_service.dart`, 357 lines)
- **Dependency:** Singleton - test using `initialize(useWebSocket: false)` (legacy polling mode)
  to avoid real WebSocket connections.

| Method / scenario | What to test |
|---|---|
| `initialize(useWebSocket: false)` | `currentUserPresence` is not null after init |
| `updateCurrentUserPresence()` | `currentUserPresence` reflects new status/activity |
| `setGameActivity()` | Presence activity updated; notifies listeners |
| `clearGameActivity()` | Activity cleared; notifies listeners |
| `canUserJoinGame(userId)` | Returns `true` when user is `online`/`idle`; `false` when `inGame`/`offline` |
| `watchUserPresence(userId)` | Stream emits when `updateFriendPresence` is called |
| `dispose()` | No throw; timers cancelled |

#### `TypingIndicatorService` COMPLETE
- `test/core/services/presence/typing_indicator_service_test.dart` added
- Coverage: `isAnyoneTyping`, `isCurrentUserTyping`, `startTyping`, `stopTyping`,
  `updateUserTypingStatus`, `handleTextInput`, `handleMessageSent`, `clearConversationTyping`,
  `getTypingText`, `getTypingStats`

### 3c. Auth flow edge cases (not yet tested)
- Social login flows (OAuth token injection, account linking)
- Token refresh when `AuthHttpClient` encounters a 401 on a concurrent request
- Offline login attempt (cached credentials vs. no cache)
- Logout clears all stored tokens and in-memory state

### 3d. Widget tree tests (not yet tested)
- Leaderboard screen renders `AnimatedRankBadge` and `EnhancedScoreDisplay` correctly
  (basic rendering exists in `test/widgets/leaderboard_widgets_test.dart` - extend with
  interaction tests)
- `ArcadeGameShell` mounts the correct game widget for each `ArcadeGameId`
- `DailyBonusScreen` renders correct coins/gems/streak values from `ArcadeDailyBonusService`
- `ArcadeMissionsScreen` renders claimed vs. unclaimed missions correctly

### 3e. Other service gaps COMPLETE

| File added | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `test/arcade/services/arcade_session_service_test.dart` | `startSession()`, `endSession()`, `attachDuration()` |
| `test/arcade/services/arcade_registry_test.dart` | All 3 game definitions, IDs, titles, difficulties, `ArcadeGameId` completeness |
| `test/arcade/leaderboards/local_arcade_leaderboard_service_test.dart` | `recordRun()`, `top()` (sort order, limit), `best()`, `wouldBeNewBest()`, `clearBoard()`, `clearAll()`, persistence, `topForGame()` |

---

## 4. Phase 4 - Dependency Audit

### 4a. Outdated packages
- **Action:** Run `flutter pub outdated` in a Flutter-enabled environment.
- **Goal:** Apply security fixes; identify packages with breaking-change upgrades.
- **Note:** `just_audio` (music streaming) and `flutter_soloud` (low-latency SFX) are
  intentionally kept separate - different use cases, not consolidatable.

### 4b. Unused transitive dependencies
- **Action:** Run `flutter pub deps --style=compact` and cross-reference with imports.
- **Goal:** Remove any transitive packages pulled in by old features that were removed.

---

## 5. Sprint 1 - P2 Auth Integration Verification

Status is unknown - may already be complete. Needs explicit verification:

- [ ] `AuthHttpClient` provider is registered in the Riverpod provider graph (confirm in
  `lib/game/providers/core_providers.dart` or `auth_providers.dart`)
- [ ] Login screen shows correct error messages for 401, 403, 422, network timeout
- [ ] Signup screen validates and surfaces backend error codes
- [ ] Auto-refresh (token renewal on 401) tested end-to-end with a live or stub backend

---

## 6. Sprint 2 - Networking Layer

Not started. Estimated ~70 min.

- [ ] Copy 4 networking files into `lib/core/networking/`
- [ ] Add `web_socket_channel` and `uuid` to `pubspec.yaml`
- [ ] Add 3 new Riverpod providers (WebSocket connection, message stream, reconnect logic)
- [ ] Integrate with existing HTTP layer (`AuthHttpClient` -> `HttpClient` -> WebSocket upgrade)

---

## 7. Synaptix Runtime Validation

**Blocked** - requires a running physical/simulator device and a live backend.
Curl CONNECT tunnel failure blocks live smoke-checking in CI. Flutter SDK not on PATH in CI.

- [ ] App launch - no crash, no ANR
- [ ] Auth/bootstrap flow - login, token refresh, session establishment
- [ ] Onboarding - age group selection -> mode mapping (`Kids`/`Teen`/`Adult`)
- [ ] Hub rendering - correct mode-specific content for each Synaptix mode
- [ ] Arena/Labs/Pathways/Journey/Circles/Command navigation - all routes reachable
- [ ] Brand validation - no visible "Trivia Tycoon" strings anywhere in the UI
- [ ] Retention hooks - daily bonus prompt, mission notification after first session
- [ ] Premium Hub - upgrade prompt, feature gating, paywall rendering

---

## 8. Synaptix Backend - Packet E (Deferred)

Intentionally deferred to after Alpha launch. No urgency.

- [ ] Namespace rename: `Tycoon.Backend.*` -> `Synaptix.Backend.*` across all backend projects
- [ ] Service/telemetry identifier rename
- [ ] Docker/CI/issuer/audience configuration naming cleanup

---

## 9. Web Platform - Remaining `dart:io` Screen Files

**Startup fixed:** `api_service.dart` and `auth_error_messages.dart` no longer import
`dart:io`, eliminating the startup cascade failure on web.

The following files still import `dart:io` unconditionally. They are **not** in the startup
path so the app loads on web, but these screens/features will throw when visited on web:

| File | Used in | Impact on web |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `lib/ui_components/spin_wheel/services/prize_log_export_service.dart` | Spin-wheel export | File export will fail |
| `lib/ui_components/shimmer_avatar/widgets/avatar_content.dart` | Avatar display | Avatar widget will throw |
| `lib/ui_components/shimmer_avatar/utils/avatar_helpers.dart` | Avatar helpers | Avatar feature will throw |
| `lib/ui_components/profile_avatar/profile_image_picker.dart` | Avatar upload | File picker unavailable on web |
| `lib/ui_components/depth_card_3d/core/depth_card_3d.dart` | 3D cards | May throw if `dart:io` class is instantiated |
| `lib/ui_components/confetti/utils/confetti_log_manager.dart` | Confetti debug overlay | Debug-only; low impact |
| `lib/ui_components/color_picker/utils/color_log_manager.dart` | Color picker | Debug-only; low impact |
| `lib/screens/profile/widgets/profile_avatar_preview.dart` | Profile screen | Avatar preview will throw |
| `lib/screens/profile/widgets/shimmer_avatar.dart` | Profile screen | Shimmer avatar will throw |
| `lib/screens/profile/widgets/avatar_image_card.dart` | Profile screen | Avatar card will throw |
| `lib/screens/profile/widgets/avatar_package_image.dart` | Profile screen | Avatar image will throw |
| `lib/screens/profile/tabs/collection_tab.dart` | Profile -> Collections tab | Collections tab will throw |
| `lib/game/services/avatar_package_service.dart` | Avatar packages | Service will throw on web |
| `lib/game/services/collection_items_loader.dart` | Collection items | Loader will throw on web |
| `lib/game/controllers/profile_avatar_controller.dart` | Profile avatar | Controller will throw on web |
| `lib/admin/widgets/encrypted_file_preview.dart` | Admin | Admin only; low web priority |
| `lib/admin/widgets/question_editor_form.dart` | Admin | Admin only; low web priority |
| `lib/admin/questions/question_list_screen.dart` | Admin | Admin only; low web priority |
| `lib/admin/questions/file_import_export_screen.dart` | Admin | Admin only; low web priority |

**Recommended action:** For each file, either add `kIsWeb` guards around file-system calls
or use conditional imports to provide web-safe stubs.

## 10. Windows Build Prerequisite

### 10a. NuGet required for `flutter_inappwebview_windows`
- **Status:** prerequisite not satisfied on the current Windows environment
- **Observed failure:** Windows build fails with `NUGET-NOTFOUND` / exit code `9009`
  while resolving `flutter_inappwebview_windows` native dependencies.
- **Required fix:** install `nuget.exe` and make sure it is available on `PATH`
  before running `flutter build windows`.
- **Recommended verification:**
  - `nuget help`
  - `flutter clean`
  - `flutter pub get`
  - `flutter build windows`
- **Important note:** the CMake `CMP0175` warning from the plugin is noisy but was
  not the primary blocker in the reported failure; missing NuGet was the actual
  build-stopping condition.

---

---

## 11. Audio / MinIO Integration

### 11a. Frontend – COMPLETE

All frontend wiring for remote audio (music + SFX) is in place.

**Music streaming:**
- `lib/core/services/audio/audio_asset_response.dart` — response model
- `lib/core/services/audio/audio_asset_service.dart` — presigned-URL service with
  2-minute pre-expiry cache; supports `category` param (`'songs'` or `'sfx'`).
  Backend endpoint: `GET /v1/assets/audio/{category}/{filename}`
- `lib/game/providers/core_providers.dart` — `audioAssetServiceProvider` registered
- `lib/audio/controller/audio_controller.dart` — `AudioAssetService?` injected;
  `_playCurrentSongInPlaylist()` fetches presigned URL and streams via `just_audio`;
  SoLoud local file is the fallback on any error
- `lib/audio/models/songs.dart` — updated to all 12 real song filenames from
  `tycoon-assets/songs/` bucket

**SFX streaming:**
- Same `AudioAssetService` (category: `'sfx'`) fetches SFX presigned URLs
- `_preloadRemoteSfx()` pre-fetches all SFX types on init into per-type
  `ja.AudioPlayer` instances
- `playSfx()` checks `_remoteSfxCache` first; falls back to SoLoud local SFX
- Local SFX always preloaded first so remote failure is always graceful

**Option A verification path:**
- `playRemoteMusic(String presignedUrl)` public method accepts a direct MinIO
  presigned URL for local testing without needing the backend endpoint

### 11b. Backend – PENDING

The backend endpoint does not yet exist. Needs to be implemented server-side:

```
GET /v1/assets/audio/{category}/{filename}
```
- Validates user session / entitlement
- `category` values: `songs`, `sfx`
- Returns:
  ```json
  {
    "presignedUrl": "http://...",
    "expiresAt": "2026-04-18T12:00:00Z",
    "contentType": "audio/mpeg",
    "cacheHints": { "maxAgeSeconds": 3600 }
  }
  ```
- MinIO bucket: `tycoon-assets` (API: `http://127.0.0.1:9000`, Console: `http://127.0.0.1:9001`)
- Song objects: `songs/{filename}` (e.g. `songs/end_game.mp3`)
- SFX objects: `sfx/{filename}` (e.g. `sfx/k1.mp3`)

### 11c. SFX asset files – PENDING

The bundled `assets/sfx/` directory does not contain the expected SFX files referenced in
`lib/audio/models/sounds.dart`. Only `assets/sounds/cha_ching.mp3` is present.

- [ ] Either add bundled SFX files to `assets/sfx/` for local fallback
- [ ] Or rely entirely on MinIO-hosted SFX (requires backend endpoint from 11b)

Expected local SFX files (from `sounds.dart`):
`hash1-3.mp3`, `wssh1-2.mp3`, `dsht1.mp3`, `ws1.mp3`, `spsh1.mp3`, `hh1-2.mp3`,
`kss1.mp3`, `k1-2.mp3`, `p1-2.mp3`, `yay1.mp3`, `wehee1.mp3`, `oo1.mp3`,
`fwfwfwfwfw1.mp3`, `fwfwfwfw1.mp3`, `swishswish1.mp3`

---

## 12. Code Quality – Resolved (2026-04-18)

### 12a. Nullability warnings – COMPLETE
- Onboarding `userData` casts: all `as String?` replaced with `is` type guards
  (`onboarding_controller.dart`, `onboarding_screen.dart`)
- Skill-tree map lookup: `byId[id]!` replaced with guarded local variable
  (`skill_tree_controller.dart`)
- `cast<Map>()` replaced with `whereType<Map>()` (`skill_tree_nav_repository.dart`)
- `withOpacity` → `withValues(alpha:)` (`store_item_card.dart`, `status_indicator.dart`)
- `colorScheme.surfaceVariant` → `surfaceContainerHighest` (4 files)
- Broken `assert` logic fixed in `fluid_nav_bar_icon.dart`
- Dead `@Deprecated` methods deleted from `term_of_service.dart`

### 12b. Compile errors – COMPLETE
- `power_up.dart`: `int?`/`String?` type mismatches fixed with `?? 0` / `?? ''`
- `login_screen.dart`: non-existent `SecureStorage.isNotEmpty` removed
- `play_quiz_screen.dart`: undefined `width` replaced with constants `60`/`40`

### 12c. API client rename – COMPLETE
- `TycoonApiClient` → `SynaptixApiClient` across all 13 affected files
- File: `tycoon_api_client.dart` → `synaptix_api_client.dart`
- Provider: `tycoonApiClientProvider` → `synaptixApiClientProvider`
- Field: `tycoonApiClient` → `synaptixApiClient`
