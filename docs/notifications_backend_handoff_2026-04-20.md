# Player Notifications Backend API Handoff

> **Audience:** Frontend + backend teams  
> **Date:** 2026-04-20  
> **Scope:** Player inbox + unread count + lightweight realtime refresh

---

## Status

Player notifications v1 are now implemented and registered in the backend route surface.

Implemented routes:

- `GET /notifications/inbox`
- `GET /notifications/unread-count`
- `POST /notifications/{notificationId}/read`
- `POST /notifications/read-all`
- `DELETE /notifications/{notificationId}`

Validated on **April 20, 2026** with:

- `dotnet test Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests\Tycoon.Backend.Api.Tests.csproj --no-build --no-restore --filter "PlayerNotificationsEndpointsTests|MessagesEndpointsTests"`
- Result: `Passed (8/8)`

Current v1 notification sources:

- friend request received
- friend request accepted
- onboarding reward claimed as a simple system notification

This is a dedicated player inbox domain. It is separate from admin notification history and should be treated as the source of truth for player notifications.

---

## Contract Summary

The frontend should treat notifications as a backend-owned inbox rather than local sample state.

### Read and mutation routes

- `GET /notifications/inbox`
- `GET /notifications/unread-count`
- `POST /notifications/{notificationId}/read`
- `POST /notifications/read-all`
- `DELETE /notifications/{notificationId}`

### Auth behavior

- bearer auth required for every route
- inbox is always implicitly "me"
- no `{playerId}` path is used for notifications v1

### Pagination behavior

`GET /notifications/inbox` supports optional query parameters:

- `page`
- `pageSize`

If omitted, the backend defaults to:

- `page = 1`
- `pageSize = 50`

---

## DTO Shape

Each inbox item is returned in this canonical shape:

```json
{
  "id": "6d0b0d2f-19f3-4d0a-a0a7-4f5c8e1931fd",
  "type": "friend",
  "title": "New friend request",
  "body": "Sarah sent you a friend request.",
  "createdAtUtc": "2026-04-20T12:00:00Z",
  "unread": true,
  "actionRoute": "/friends",
  "payload": {
    "requestId": "fd46c9eb-7cb8-4380-94c8-c30dffb8dbef",
    "fromPlayerId": "9e8f0e85-e1bb-42c5-9184-1b2685151f7d"
  },
  "icon": "person_add",
  "avatarUrl": "https://example.test/avatar.png"
}
```

Current important fields:

- `type`
  v1 currently emits `friend` and `system`
- `actionRoute`
  current values are route-like frontend navigation targets such as `/friends` and `/wallet`
- `payload`
  structured JSON object surfaced from JSON-backed backend storage
- `avatarUrl`
  optional and nullable

Paginated inbox response:

```json
{
  "items": [],
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 50,
  "total": 0,
  "totalPages": 0
}
```

Unread count response:

```json
{
  "unreadCount": 3
}
```

## Realtime Refresh

The inbox endpoints remain the source of truth. Realtime is only a freshness signal in v1.

Current backend behavior:

- when a new player notification is created, the backend emits a refresh event over `/ws/notify`
- when notification read state changes, the backend emits a refresh event over `/ws/notify`

Current lightweight player event:

- `NotificationInboxUpdated`

Message payload shape:

```json
{
  "playerId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "unreadCount": 2,
  "reason": "created",
  "occurredAtUtc": "2026-04-20T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Frontend guidance:

- treat websocket events as a refresh signal only
- refetch `GET /notifications/inbox` and `GET /notifications/unread-count` after receiving the event
- do not treat the websocket event itself as a replacement for inbox hydration

---

## Frontend Integration Notes

- notifications screen should hydrate from `GET /notifications/inbox`
- notification badge counts should hydrate from `GET /notifications/unread-count`
- opening a notification should call `POST /notifications/{notificationId}/read`
- "mark all read" should call `POST /notifications/read-all`
- swipe-to-dismiss/delete should call `DELETE /notifications/{notificationId}`

The backend does not provide a separate archive endpoint in v1. Deletion is hard delete from the player inbox record.

---

## Error Handling

Notifications use the shared backend-standard nested error envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "FORBIDDEN",
    "message": "Notification does not belong to the authenticated user.",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

Current common error codes:

- `UNAUTHORIZED`
- `FORBIDDEN`
- `NOT_FOUND`

Frontend should parse:

- `error.code`
- `error.message`
- `error.details`

---

## Current Limits

Notifications v1 intentionally does not yet include:

- achievements/challenges/gameplay alerts
- rich notification preferences
- notification categories endpoint
- bulk delete endpoint
- server-pushed full notification payload sync

Those can be layered on top of the current inbox model without changing the basic route family above.
